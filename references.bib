The number of virus particles on Earth is frequently reported in the scientific literature and in general-interest publications as being on the order of 1031, with some confusion about whether this is a high or low estimate. This number is often given without a source, although it should be attributed to a paper by Hendrix et al. published in 1999 (R. W. Hendrix, M. C. Smith, R. N. Burns, M. E. Ford, and G. F.

ABSTRACT 
The number of virus particles on Earth is frequently reported in the scientific literature and in general-interest publications as being on the order of 1031, with some confusion about whether this is a high or low estimate. This number is often given without a source, although it should be attributed to a paper by Hendrix et al. published in 1999 (R. W. Hendrix, M. C. Smith, R. N. Burns, M. E. Ford, and G. F. Hatfull, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96:2192–2197, 1999, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.5.2192). As with any oft-repeated statistic, it is informative to know how it has been derived and whether it should be revised in the light of new evidence. I review the history of the 1031 estimate and use more recent assessments of the number of bacterial and viral particles in various habitats to conclude that the best estimate of the number of virus particles on Earth (“the Hendrix product”) remains close to 1031 and is unlikely to be either much less or much more than that.

	Abstract = {Microbiomes from every environment contain a myriad of uncultivated archaeal and bacterial viruses, but studying these viruses is hampered by the lack of a universal, scalable taxonomic framework. We present vConTACT v.2.0, a network-based application utilizing whole genome gene-sharing profiles for virus taxonomy that integrates distance-based hierarchical clustering and confidence scores for all taxonomic predictions. We report near-identical (96%) replication of existing genus-level viral taxonomy assignments from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses for National Center for Biotechnology Information virus RefSeq. Application of vConTACT v.2.0 to 1,364 previously unclassified viruses deposited in virus RefSeq as reference genomes produced automatic, high-confidence genus assignments for 820 of the 1,364. We applied vConTACT v.2.0 to analyze 15,280 Global Ocean Virome genome fragments and were able to provide taxonomic assignments for 31% of these data, which shows that our algorithm is scalable to very large metagenomic datasets. Our taxonomy tool can be automated and applied to metagenomes from any environment for virus classification.},
